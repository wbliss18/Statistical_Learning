# Statistical_Learning

Description:
Modern methods of supervised learning. Linear and polynomial regression; classification; model assessment and selection; model inference; simulation and re-sampling; neural networks; special topics.

Final Project: 
For this project, we will apply linear and logistic regression to the dataset. With each type of regression, we
will arrive at a model. We will use each model to try to predict the outcome (low birth weight or not) based
on the womanâ€™s medical features.
