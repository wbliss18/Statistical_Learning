Description:
Modern methods of supervised learning. Linear and polynomial regression; classification; model assessment and selection; model inference; simulation and re-sampling; neural networks; special topics.

HW1:
The dataset zipcode contains rows of data with 256 values per row, each value representing the darkness
of a pixel in a 16x16 image of handwritten digits collected from the US Postal Service. We use this data
to train classifiers to identify digits in a testing dataset. For the purposes of this code, we only classify the
digits 2 and 3.

HW2:
The code for this assignment uses ADABoost to select a committee of random lines that best classify a region of points.

HW3:
For this assignment, we use Ridge Regression to classify data.

HW4:
Application of Mahalanobis Distance for classification using multivariate normal probability.

HW5:
Classification of vowels.

HW6:
Using the bootstrap method to manually find regression estimates.

HW7:
Applying a neural network to classify images through pixels.

Final Project - Linear vs. Logistic Regression: A Study on Low Birth Weight: 
For this project, we will apply linear and logistic regression to the dataset. With each type of regression, we
will arrive at a model. We will use each model to try to predict the outcome (low birth weight or not) based
on the womanâ€™s medical features.
