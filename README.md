Description:
Modern methods of supervised learning. Linear and polynomial regression; classification; model assessment and selection; model inference; simulation and re-sampling; neural networks; special topics.

HW1:
The dataset zipcode contains rows of data with 256 values per row, each value representing the darkness
of a pixel in a 16x16 image of handwritten digits collected from the US Postal Service. We use this data
to train classifiers to identify digits in a testing dataset. For the purposes of this code, we only classify the
digits 2 and 3.

Final Project: 
For this project, we will apply linear and logistic regression to the dataset. With each type of regression, we
will arrive at a model. We will use each model to try to predict the outcome (low birth weight or not) based
on the womanâ€™s medical features.
